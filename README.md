### Namaste! üôè

I am the *founder* and *Director of Research* at the **Center for Cognition, Computation, and Climate Research** (*C4R*) based in Nepal.

I have over ten years of interdisciplinary research experience, having previously worked at Saarland University (Germany), the Basque Center on Cognition, Brain and Language (Spain), and the Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences (India).

As a [cognitive scientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y0HnEQwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I am passionate about understanding human cognition‚Äîbehavior, brain, and language.
I focus on topics such as multilingual language processing, metacognition, visual priming, executive control across the lifespan, neurodiversity, and cognitive (neuro)science at large. 

My [research](https://zenodo.org/records/12192494) in climate science includes understanding the interaction between increasing global temperatures and extreme weather events and how these phenomena affect people's livelihoods, particularly in regions like Nepal with small carbon footprints.
